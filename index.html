<p>
    I am an astrophysicist specializing in Bayesian statistical inference and numerical methods. My current main topic
    is the development of <a href="https://github.com/renecotyfanboy/jaxspec">jaxspec</a>, a spectral fitting library
    suitable for the coming decades of X-ray astrophysics. I am also working on gas motions in galaxy clusters, using
    machine learning and indirect observations to infer the turbulent energy of the ICM.
