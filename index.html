<p>
    I am an astrophysicist specializing in Bayesian statistical inference and numerical methods. My current main topic
    is the development of <a href="https://github.com/renecotyfanboy/jaxspec">jaxspec</a>, a spectral fitting library
    suitable for the coming decades of X-ray astrophysics, proposing state-of-the-art and machine learning boosted inference
    algorithms. I am also using neural networks to study gas motions
    in galaxy clusters, using indirect observations to infer the turbulent energy of the ICM.
